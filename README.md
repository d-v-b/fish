This repository contains a handful of tools for basic data analysis in the Ahrens lab: 

* ephys data: loading ephys data from binary files, estimation of fictive swim events
* imaging data: loading images + metadata from our light sheet microscope, basic (linear) image registration using [dipy](http://nipy.org/dipy/)

Installation: until I get around to putting this repo on `pip` or `conda`, this library can be installed by cloning this repository and running `python setup.py install` in the resulting directory.
